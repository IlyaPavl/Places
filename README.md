# Places

One of my largest and most comprehensive projects. This is a project that can be used to save favorite places in any city. To your favorite place you can add Photo, name (mandatory field), place, type of establishment and rating. It is also possible to sort by Date, Name and Rating. The data entered by the user is saved in the Realm database. 
1. The project was implemented using UIKit
2. Implemented MVC architecture
3. Used CoreLocation and MapKit
4. Used Realm as a database
5. Dependency manager - CocoaPods
6. Used multithreading, DispatchQueue
7. Adhered to DRY, KISS, SOLID approach where necessary
